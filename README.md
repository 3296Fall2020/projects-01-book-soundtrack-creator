## Project Overview

## Vision Statement

For avid readers of books who want to dive into the mood of their books, the Book Soundtrack Creator is an application that takes the entered title of a book and creates a playlist that matches the feeling the novel gives off. Unlike other applications that allow you to only create playlists that you think are right for your book, our product provides you with a generated playlist that matches the tone of the book with just the ease of entering the title and hitting create. 

## Personas

Andrew:

Alec, age 34, is a librarian who works for a grade school in the greater Philadelphia area. He keeps track of all books coming in and out of the library, as well as teaching kids, ages 10 to 13, how the library organization system works and about famous books through history. He was born in Washington D.C where both of his parents worked in the Library of Congress, sharing their love of books with him every night. After completing a degree in history at Temple University, he moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia to get his career started. When he gets home, he does all the necessary tasks of an adult in his 30s but when its time to relax, he pulls out his books and starts reading till its time to sleep.

Alec is very connected to the internet and applications to make the library organization much easier, as well as learn more about the books he wants to teach his students about. Alec might use the Book Soundtrack Creator to not only learn more about the mood and tones of the books he likes to read, but to also explain books better to his students through the generated playlists. The use of the application would especially help him understand books he never read before as well, explaining the feeling of the books entered before he even gets to read anything about them.

Jake:

Anthony, age 30, hosts a large YouTube channel and business in which he reviews music, albums, etc. While he is based in NYC his YouTube channel attracts users and music listeners from all over. He was born in Brooklyn where both of his parents were musicians and music teachers. He has a degree in music but does not create/release much of his own music but instead provides commentary on the music industry.

Anthony, who has typically done daily/weekly music analysis videos and album reviews until this point, is now thinking about creating a new series of videos based on the mood/data of music as well as suggesting book recommendations relative to music. Anthony could use Book Soundtrack Creator in multiple ways. He could use it to determine if his initial analysis of a book and music pair is accurate. If he is uncertain of what music would pair well with a book this app could provide a solution. Lastly, as he reviews books and music, Book Soundtrack Creator can create a public playlist he can share with his followers.
